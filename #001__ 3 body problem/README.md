# 3-Body Problem Simulation

## Description

This program simulates the gravitational interactions between three bodies in space. Built using Python and Pygame, it allows users to create three masses with varying sizes by clicking and holding the mouse button; the size of each mass depends on the duration of the click. The simulation then calculates and visualizes the gravitational forces acting between these masses, showing their movements on the screen. Users can reset the simulation at any time by pressing the 'R' key.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame

### Steps

1. Ensure Python and Pygame are installed on your system. Pygame can be installed via pip if you already have Python:

```bash
pip install pygame
```


2. Download the 'main.py' or any of the other scripts from the repository to get started

### Controls

1. **Mouse Click and Hold**: Create a mass at the cursor's position. The longer you hold, the larger the mass.
2. **R Key**: Reset the simulation, clearing all masses from the screen.
3. **SPACEBAR**: Pauses the simulation
4. **Q Key**: Quits the simulation and closes window.
